title: Up & Running With JekyllNow
---

Thanks to Github + Jekyll + JekyllNow, I finally have my own blog up and running in really no time (Okay 10 minutes to be precise).


For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub or visit [Homepage](http://www.jekyllnow.com/). You can also check the nicely detailed post by him about [Building a Blog UsingJekyll Now](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)


Though if you want to explore this into more details and learn you might not prefer this approach. To setup a blog similar to one that JekyllNow helps to build, you will need to explore [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
